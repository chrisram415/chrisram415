STORYTIME
With a warm smile and a dash of humor, I made the leap from an 8-year gig in education and program management to the exciting world of Customer Success. My mission is all about bridging gaps and giving a hand with a touch of humor.🌈

Born and raised in sunny San Francisco, I've got a soft spot for the '80s and all things nerdy, which drives my artistic endeavors.
I love to whip up art that gets folks laughing, cringing, and going "WOW" – it's a bit of cute, a bit of creepy, like a match made in Halloween heaven, I'd say! 💀🎨

But most of all I am super passionate about building connections with folks, helping us all achieve our goals. What impacts one of us, impacts us all. 🧀



My main goal is to make a positive impact by bringing tech and empathy together. If you're on board with this vision, let's chat and see how we can make some success together. 😄🚀
