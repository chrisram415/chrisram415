🌈 Hey, I'm Chris! I went from an 8-year education and program management career to the vibrant world of Customer Success. Born and raised in sunny San Francisco, I'm a total '80s nerd, which fuels my art – a delightful mix of cute and creepy. 💀🎨

But, what I'm most passionate about is connecting with people, because what impacts one of us, impacts us all. 🧀

My main goal is to blend tech with empathy for a positive impact. If you're on board, let's chat and create success together! 😄🚀
